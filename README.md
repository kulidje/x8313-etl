# X8313 Extract Transform Load Code
The following is a code excerpt from X8313 Inc. and not necessarily fully functional. The purpose of this repo is only to showcase my work and not intended for use.

This is the Core ETL Pipeline code used for collecting and processing historical horse-racing data from X8313's various proprietary data sources.

A simple but tedious collection of pre-processing wrappers used for reading raw-data and transforming it to clean processed Pandas DataFrames which get stored in an AWS RDS Data Lake.

Not sexy, but massively time-consuming (in the short-run), time-saving (in the long-run) and essential to any data-analysis project.
