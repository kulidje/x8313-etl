# X8313-ETL
Code excerpt from X8313 Inc. This is the core ETL Pipeline code used for collecting and processing historical horse racing data from various proprietary data sources.

Simple but tedious pre-processing wrapper for taking raw-data and transforming into clean processed Pandas DataFrames. 

Not sexy, but massively time-consuming, time-saving and essential to any data-analysis project.
